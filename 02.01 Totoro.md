### A Brief history of Totoro
- reflects many of Miyazaki;s own experience: his mother suffered from spinal tuberculosis for nine years, and spent much of her time hospitalized.
### Totoro and Autobiography
- Mei was modeled on Miyazaki's niece
- "Totoro are goblins of the transitional phase when Japan hadn't become entirely modernized"
- think that a cat goblin has turned into a bus
- creating a story like Oshin or somthing from the Meiji period seems as distant as making a film with a foreign setting
### Themes to Explore
- light and dark "light is good and dark is evil, I dislike this dichotomy"
- "dont think things can be treated with that kind of duality""gods are usually deep in the forest or mountains"
### The world of Totoro
- this sense of dark awe is the sort of veneration that japanses have toward certain forests and natural obeject. Many places has "forest shouldn't be entered"
- Totoro is "not a spirit"
- if darkness is gone, my existance would grow shallow
### Dream and Reality
- Mei first meets him are basically presented so that it is unclear whether they were real or a dream
- Of course, I think they really happened
- ***it doesn't matter if these are "real" but rather if they are "meaningful"***
### Kami
- In Japanese there is no "wind" kami
- Totoro has a relationship with all of nature
- Japanese gods are laughing gods (generally optimistic?)
- Kami is not for salvation/afterlife/save people's souls. Rather than paradise or heaven, people are reborn into teh mountains or the earth, or trees growing nearby.
### Totoro vs Nature and Technology
- "umbrella" as technelogy. Totoro does not need it, nor he know if he needs to return it.
- Totoro think it as musicla instrument. He think it is best to give some acorns to reciprocate.
