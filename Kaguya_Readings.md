### Individualism and femininity
- The Tale of Princess Kaguya, tackle the problematic of femininity and its position in late modernity
- Furthermore, in soft tones of emotional transcendence, they obtrusively display parables on the risk and responsibilities of uncontrollable power in the hands of individuals, and thus provide symbolic undertones of female empowerment through the prism of the weight of personal choices in the midst of increasing popularity and solitude, so that Andersen’s fairy-tale respectively the old Japanese folk-tale become spaces of longing, and paradoxically, belonging. 
- redefinition of femininity as a site of acceptance and compassion, instead of an active interplay of competition and power,
### The will to love and the struggles of feminism
- The reconsideration of the concept of “love” as the core element of female identity and the very force which instigates female spirituality, its re-capturing by means of products of popular, and draws on three main ideas:
	- the failure of the paternal figure: Parental love appears as a means to restrict and condition children, and lead those children into inevitable crises which, eventually, will only strengthen their sense of self
	-  the failure of romantic entanglements as the solution to all evils: her fulfilment as an individual results from the dissolution of gender limitations and the sublimation of her own fears, either by acknowledging that runaway to the past and the recurrent loneliness are not valid alternatives to her current life, or by accepting that there are choices one makes in the rage of the moment
	- it indicates of that moment when the necessity and inevitability of building an own identity become imperative, accompanied by an urgent sense of self-awareness and responsibility: Princess Kaguya learns that runaway and hiding are no sustainable solutions, and she must face the realities of growing up and confront the outer world with her own innermost yearnings and desires – and fears,
- Overcoming the individual levels of self-questioning and self-recovery, this process of identity construction finds its completion in unexpected ways
- The Tale of Princess Kaguya tackles the “feminine woman” in an empowering and liberating manner, transcending the fears and limitations imposed upon the feminist discourse,

>Bryce and Davis, The Tale of the Princess Kaguya

- the purposeful accentuation of Kaguya’s experiences of the living world is key to evaluating the anime’s connections between human and nonhuman nature
- Kaguya’s inner struggle with the suffocating, commodity-driven, urban life world of social betterment and intergenerational determination is one aspect of Takahata’s allegorical accentuation of the legend.

- One aspect that the government viewed as central to modern education—the cultivation of obedience to one’s parents— is well reflected in the way the story about Kaguya-hime is transformed in government-sanctioned textbooks
- Kaguya-hime in modern versions appears as a baby, a child, or a girl who is adorable and emotional. Such a Kaguyahime has replaced the awesomely beautiful but cold-hearted moon-lady who populates premodern editions. Likewise, the bamboo cutter who appears as the main character in nara ehon and nara emaki and has strong feelings for Kaguya-hime, serves a more marginal role in modern manga. These changes have affected the plot immensely.
