### Anime and 3/11 (Fukushima)
- "Triple disaster" (earthquake, Tsunami, Nuclear)
- Anime as a way of dealing with national trauma (from war to natural disasters)
- Cultural reassurance
- PR campaigns for safety (food production)
### Ghibli and Shinkai
- While Miyazaki and Takahata can be seen as understanding Japanese history in relation to WWII, Shinkai is addressing more recent events.
- Catharsis versus distress
- Reassurance versus Deassurance
- Two disaster scenes
### Urban vs Rural
- Taki's urban environment is easily recognizable through iconic Tokyo spots, such as Shinjuku Station or Tokyo Sky Tree
- The lifestyle seems highly influenced by Western consumer ideals like cloths and, more importantly, food. Taki works part-time at an Italian restaurant, and his classmates predominately consume Western fast food. 
- The family bonds seem weak and community is always related to school or work. Only in one scene does Taki’s father appear, a stereotypical white-collar worker (sararii man) who only speaks a few distant words to him at the breakfast table.
### Social life: Taki
- Taki’s social life centers around his classmates and his older female shift leader, whom he has a crush on. 
- Tokyo basically seems like a rather cold and rough place (e.g., some youngsters menace him at his part-time job)
- Friendship compensates for the competitive living conditions in the overloaded metropolis.
### Rural Japan
- In comparison, Mitsuha’s rural life largely depends on the local community and family-related activities. 
- The grandmother is in charge of the local shrine and regards Mitsuha and her sister as the potential successors of its old
- traditions like producing kuchikamizake
### Rural in Your Name
- When compared with the movies of Takahata and Miyazaki, the depiction of rural Japan remains rather neutral in Your Name. 
- Life in Itomori is not more desirable than life in Tokyo per se, although there are aesthetic landscapes and old traditions. 
- she also criticizes the inconvenient aspects of rural life like limited public transport and medical service. 
- When Taki inhabits Mitsuha’s body, he also does not recognize any merits of living in the countryside
- only discovers Itomori Town in Tokyo by accident in an exhibition on rural photography titled "Nostalgia."
- There is no celebration of country
### Center and Periphery in Japan
- Tension between urban areas as “center” and rural as periphery. 
- Exploitation of periphery by the center
- the crashing comet proves an inevitable and unpredictable natural disaster for which no serious preparations or countermeasures were possible
### Rethinking the Rural and Urban
- Your Name questions the disconnection of rural and urban
- Notions of interdependence and “internal colonization”
- Opportunity for unification
### Healing Genres and Emotional Catharsis
- In its alternate storyline, Your Name  offers the chance to avoid the deaths of hundreds of people, even if the rural town, culture, and landscape were ultimately destroyed.
### New Understanding of Space
- Your Name depicts a rather complex image of “the rural” in contemporary Japan without falling into a naive binary of “the good village” and “the bad city.” 
- The conflict of where life seems more valuable and desirable remains unsolved, even if the urban environment proves to be more convenient in comparison. 
- the movie can establish a certain realism coexisting with its fantastic elements of spiritualism, time travel, and body swapping.
