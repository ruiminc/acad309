### Shoujo
- Contrast to traditional forms: strong and independent
- bravery, inquisitiveness, risk-taking
- a world both exotic and familiar
- "de-familiarizes reality" to create his own moral and aesthetic universe
### What is possible
- Collective visions of hope and renewal
- Balance between fear and enpowerment
- Agency in relation to nature itself (but not necessarily opposition)
- Nature "is" but doesn't "act" (harmony)
### What kind of World?
- Balance of strange and familiar
- Heroine must "make sense" and organically emerge from that world
- Sense of agency is tied to the constraints of the world: characters act in ways that make sense given the context
- Creation of fear/anxiety against which a heroine must emerge
### Representation of Women
- Taken on qualities that are stereotypically masculine
- Balanced with compassion and nurturing
- "alone" and forced to congront obstacles based only on their own inner strength and intelligence
- Flight: empowerment for shoujo characters, transcend the structures of the real (social expectation and physical limitation)
### Coming of Age
- Overcoming personal struggles and limitations
- Personal growth through adversity
- Struggle with new, unfamiliar situations
***
## Female Agency
- What kind of world is required for her/them to exist?
- What is the fear or anxiety that produces her/them?
- What conflict is overcome?
- How is she/they successful and how are the masculine and feminine ultimately balanced?
### Nausicaa
- most "not real at all" heroine but real in context
- Omnicompetent and messianic
- blend of masculine "bravery" and feminine "compassion/empathy"
- defamiliarizing the feminine (especially the battle scene)
### Totoro
- Constant sense of adventure and overcoming the "unfamiliar"
- Girls are left alone while father works, mother is in the hospital
- Characterized as adventurers, explorers
- Sense of innocence an dimagination provide a connection to enchantment
### Spirited Away
- Coming of age
- Transformation from child (spoiled) to adult (work)
- Resisted the corruption of adult-hood (consumerism, No-face's temptations)
- Ethic of "only taking what she needs"
- Growth in maturity, which also allows her to achieve
- Agency is self-created  both through demands ("give me a job") and the work that she does
