	- This image is not a direct screen shot from the film but rather a raugh work or script that depicts the overall appearance of the bathhouse. There is an iconic bridge that connects the "here" and "there" part of the world. On one end, there is a small/tiny (ちいさい) figure of Chihiro, who is from the real world, weak and unfamiliar with the challenges she is going to face. On the other end, there is the vast, mystrious and fascinating bathhouse. Meanwhile the bathhouse also seems to pose significant pressure to the tiny figure of Chihiro, almost like it will fall upon her.
	- Many elements in this image reflects "a past that is lost, vanishing, or, in the case of Spirited Away, subject to pollution and contamination" (Alistar Swale). However, some elements cannot be simply categoried neatly within the category of "critical nostalgia," a nostalgia that "privileges the (literally) ghostly past as an alternative to the mundane present" (Napier). These ideas can be seem from the old style bathhouse, the Japanese style garden to the right of the bathhouse, and the characters "油屋" and "ゆ." And altogether, it presents a complex mixed feeling of nostalgia and fantasy world.

	- In this image, Chihiro herself must have been in awe staring at the magnificant bathhouse. And even though she may not remember all these after returning to real world, there must be some impression left on her. This kind of experience reminds me of a mindset I used to have: I used to dislike travelling, because I thought that after the travel, I would soon forget what I had seen during it. As I told my mother about how I think of it, she told me that traveling is somewhat similar to reading a book or watching a film. Almost certainly, you cannot remember any detail you saw and may never recall that you have read/watched such thing. But the point of these experience is actually about the effect they have on you by then. You worship the glorious mountains, shocked by the imaginations in a book, and touched by the plots in a film. You may not remember any of these in future, but such everything together makes up your identity, belief, value and everything that defines you. And this is what coming-of-age means to me to a large extent and what memory is important of. Just like Chihiro, she might have lost her memory of her stay in the spiritual world - or it's just a dream - it doesn't matter. What matters is she has grown up, changed some of her perspectives of the world, and knows what job/responsibility is like.

Evaluation
-   How well does this image convey the overall message?  Is it effective and why or why not? (2 pts)
	- It is difficult to identify one specific overall message of the film, as *Spirited Away* talks about so many different themes and idea. This image carries a sense of nostalgia and memory, as discussed above. What is also noting is that the bathhouse itself is situated between two worlds (old and new) and is not a simple space of "purity" or "recovery" of traditional Japanese cultural identity. Instead it embodies “greed” that somewhat similar to the notion of gluttony plus avarice in the seven sins. The workers are also easily lured by consumerism. Many other idealogy can be intrepreted from this image as well. Hence, as the image features the primary location where the story happened, it effectively delivers the overall message.
