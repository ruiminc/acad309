Representation
-   What does the selected image represent to you? (2 pts)
-   How does it related to a major theme or idea of the film (2 pts)
	- The selected image depicts a general appearance of the forest covered by fungi that can release toxic gas. The overall color theme of this picture is a cold green/blue color base. The specific green in this picture green is nothing like the usual green color of the plants, which gives people a sense of nourishment or liveliness. This yellowish and cold green looks ill and suspicious, which reflects their poisonous nature.
	- The main body of this picture is the forest, and nature itself, and this picture directly links to one of the major theme of the film and the philosophy of Miyazaki: nature is neither good nor evil; it is not a sweet home that humans need to protect, instead, it is poisonous and fearsome. From my own perspective, despite the ultimate goal of the forest being to "purify" the corrupted world, I would say that the fungi themselves, along with the noxious gas, are part of nature as well. This can also explain another major theme of the film: the love of insects and plants. The princess treats all insects and plants as they naturally are. She doesn't fear them because of their horrifying appearance, nor put them above human lives.

Evocation/Animation
-   What feelings, emotions or memories are evoked by the image? (2 pts)
-   How do those responses relate to a major theme or idea of the film? (2 pts)
	- Given that this piece of art is cold color based, looking at it gives me a sense of calmness and tranquility. Looking at this scene, one can quickly realize the difference between this "forest" and the normal forest we perceive. The tree trunk is covered by those ugly bumps; they don't grow leaves or flowers; the smaller plants (fungi) are all in strange shapes. With the overall blue theme of the surroundings, this looks more like an underwater world instead of plants that grow on land. And this is another emphasis on the theme of the film: how the toxic jungle, or the nature it represents, connects so closely to the nature of water.
	- Miyazaki puts much emphasis on the five "elements" that construct his world. I believe the plants are purposely painted bluish so it can be brought closer to the features of water. Miyazaki believes water represents danger and purifying; it is neither good nor bad, but determined by your relationship with it. Bring back to the emotions evoked by this image, despite the fact that the audiences are aware of the toxic nature of the jungle, and the fact that these plants are taking away human's land, it is still difficult to hate the plants or decide to eradicate them. The plants are themselves all along. If treated properly, they are not poisonous or dangerous to humans (as Nausicaa discovered in her basement).

Evaluation
-   How well does this image convey the overall message?Â  Is it effective and why or why not? (2 pts)
	- For the overall message, we need to take into consideration of the social and political background when the film is created. Miyasaki witnessed the aftermath of the nuclear disaster in the 1940s, all the way until the 1980s when people talk about the "nuclear winter". Miyazaki, after being through all these, holds a subtle "anti-environmentalist" ideology, and I think the message is conveyed through this image very successfully. Humans are sometimes too arrogant, such that they think they are able to relate to, understand, and even protect nature. However, in fact, nature is far more powerful and complex than humans expect. This image depicts an exotic, mysterious figure of the forest and conveys the theme very well.
