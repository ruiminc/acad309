	- This picture depicts the scene where Ashitaka meets San for the first time by the riverside. San was sucking the blood out of Moro to head the wound, which is why the blood covered San's face. It is the first time that Ashikata has seen her face uncovered, and her expression shows strong determination and will. The wolf spirit's muscle is squeezed together, showing vigilance and hostility. From the lighting of this drawing, San is under the light, and Moro is trying to hide in the shadow. In this sense, the wolf spirit represents more of nature, and the kami live within it, and they are trying to avoid human activities (until humans have conquered so far that their habitat is under threats). On the other hand, San is ready to fight and is willing to serve as the hand of that spirit and take back their own land.
	- Clearly, this is not a "typical" shoujo character. Instead, it displays characteristics of the savage, unrefined, and uncontrolled femininity of nature (Wendi Sierra). The savage personality comes from the wolf spirit standing behind her, as Moro raised San as a child. San often emphasizes in the movie that she identifies herself as a wolf rather than a human. Overall, this picture shows a strong female character that the film tries to depict.

Evocation/Animation

	- One vital element of the picture is the blood on San's face. Besides the main themes that Miyazaki always discusses in his films (nature, technology, five elements, etc.), blood is usually an important concept. In *Naucicaa*, the blood of Ohm, which has tranquilizing power, plays the role of a healing medium throughout the story (Shigemi Inaga). However, in *Mononoke* it is a bit different. The red blood intensifies the situation and shows the raging and dangerous part of San. 
	- Overall, San carries a sense of "stay away from me." She is beautiful but not approachable. Until the very end, she still hates human. San and Eboshi are drawn as sympathetic characters, representing worlds that have their own unique beauty, as well as their own savagery. Miyazaki avoids the clichéd Western trope of good vs. evil and explores the issues of technology and nature in a way that affirms both.

Evaluation
-   How well does this image convey the overall message?  Is it effective and why or why not? (2 pts)
	- This image is most effective in conveying the overall message. It is the first time that the audiences see Princess Mononoke, and it carries tons of messages related to the film's theme. It inserts a strong, independent, and uncontrolled feminine figure. It discussed about nature as the mother to San, and how she is affected by nature as both a good mother (providing, caring, self-sacrificing, and inexhaustible) and a bad mother (dangerous, cruel, and torturous) (Wendi Sierra). The wolf spirit also carries Miyazaki's vision of nature as strong and forceful instead of vulnerable. It is an impressive image and provides a link to many thoughts.
