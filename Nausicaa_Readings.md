### Three concept
- #### The blood #Miscellaneus
	- The blood plays the role of a healing medium throughout the story. (small animal Teto, soldiers who have carelessly at tacked and wounded a huge beetle)
	- the tranquilizing power of the Aum's blue blood (the blue bloodshed which literally dyed Nausicaa's clothes during the rescue manoeuvre, now saves her life)
	- one of the fundamental ambivalences which makes it impossible sim ply to differentiate what is good from what is ev
- #### Love of the Insects and Plants
	- not perceived by Nausicaa as an enemy to be annihilated.
	- acks and destroys everything around it simply because it is perplexed and frightened by its inability to under stand its own reason for being in this hostile world.
	- (pollution/bio-weapon) not characterized as the absolute evil to be exterminated, but as a most unfortunate creature to be sympathized with by the heroine #Nature 
- #### Sacrifice or self-denial as singular points in history #Sacrifice 
	- survival of the involved communities often depends on the decision taken by mediating individuals (Master Yupa)
	- saving them from the infernal cycle of interminable murder and enmity.
### No good or eveil can exist a-priori #Duality

### Female Character #Shoujo 
- broadly conform to anime conventions (wide eyes, lipless mouths, stylised features which appear Caucasian to Western viewers), they too lack the overt stylisation of much anime
- the girls are inevitably part of the Japanese 'cute' (kawaii) tradition, pretty adolescents
- As Miyazaki suggests, 'We've reached a time when the male-oriented way of thinking is reaching a limit. the girl or woman has more flexibility. this is why a female point of view fits the current times
- are typically innocent, creative and attuned to nature in a way which leaves their male counterparts gaping in disbelief
- defined by curiosity, their inner and outer journeys mirrored in the image of flight
- Her reaction is not fear but awe: awe at a deadly but beautiful landscape teeming with life.
- Nausicaä shares the empathy and intuitions of Miyazaki's other heroines, Nausicaä is no "safe" heroine. The process is extended later when Yupa finds Nausicaä's secret room in the castle foundations.
- In both versions, she sees the living world - human and natural - as inherently good #Duality 
- "I love the Ohmu. I think they are the greatest, most noble creatures in all the world. But in the same way, I love all the people of the valley. Look at this dress... An old Dorok woman's memory of her daughter, yet she gave it to me. It's stained pure blue with Ohmu blood, yet there is no unpleasant smell at all. A girl from the Valley of Wind puts on a Dorok dress, dyed for her by the Ohmu, and prepares to depart in a Torumekian warship..." #Duality  
- Valley dweller explain her mistake just before the last battle. 'You (the Torumekians) use fire. We use a little of that too, but too much fire gives birth to nothing. Fire turns a forest to ash in one day. Water and wind take a hundred years to nurture a forest. We prefer water and wind.' Sadly, Kushana doesn't listen until almost too late. #Elements

Most girls compromised to the social norms: shave off eyebrows and stain their teeth back. A girl who likes insects and with such appearance have no place in such society. What will happen if she refuses the social norm and insists on running around the local hills and dales? #Shoujo
