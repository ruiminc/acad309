# Nature in Miayzaki
### What is nature?
- Anthropomorphizing
- "giving storm a name": the more humans anthropomorphize sometheing and make it an easy target for empathy the less interesting it becomes
- Nature is something far greater than ourselves, incredible force, far exceeding our own little good or evil ways
- Nature is outside of constructs of human morality, it is neither good nor evil
### Ohmu as Representation
- amalgam of childhood perspectives
- insects as childhood wonder
- "a huge creature that represents the birth of another ecosystem"
- form ot resist empathy
### Ambivalence of Form and Meaning
- hive mind, unison, power from cooperation, communication and empathy, indestructible
- vector fo the spread of the toxic jungle, serve as a resource
- We dont emphasize, and that is what make it interesting
### The forest
- if the trees had the power to curse people, human being would have been killed off by their curses a long time ago
- defenseless plants $\rightarrow$ offensive
- Nature does not need to be protected. It is not charming but fearsome.
- More ugliness than beauty
### Toxic jungle as Character
- Embodies mystery as both beauty and danger
### Technology
- like nature it's neither good nor evil
- can machine have a spirit
- build mahcines as extension of the human
- more human ot divorced from humanity
### Industrialize vs Nature
- industry treat nature as raw material/resources
- nature world has perfection in wastes
- Industry does not know balance
- War machines: "arms race". The world will run out of recourses and scarcity comes
### What is Nature
- "intention" is balance
- move towards simplicity versus human towards complexity
- morally neutral
- savage and brutal and uncaring
- Locus of *animus*
- it is beyond the viewer and Miyazaki strives for estrangement form it, rather than identification with it
