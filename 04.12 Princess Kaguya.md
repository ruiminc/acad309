### Monotagari
- Purpose is to write things down and combine the story with pictures to describe “the good things, the bad things, the strange things, the amusing things, the humorous things, and the sad things of the world.  By writing down these things and sometimes interspersing pictures among them, we are provided comfort in our idleness, and become able to recognize the events of the world, and the sadness of things.” (Norinaga, Tama no Ogushi, 1796)
