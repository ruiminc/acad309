- The non-human characters that populate animations, however, ‘can suggest both the threatening possibility of dehumanisation and the empowering possibility of going beyond any categorical notion of the human’ (ibid.).
- issue of identity, "invisible minority": we focus on the dynamics of stigmatisation and social discrimination that are dramatised in the film, while also carving out the symbolic violence and oppression that forces the children and invisible minorities to keep their non-normative identities secret.
- observe the performances of the filmic characters in their socialisation as processes of queering, disturbing, and transgressing fixed boundaries on the one hand, and passing as ‘normal’ on the other
- Understanding the mother as the agent that contains the disturbance of heteronormative order, we reflect upon this form of representing motherhood as the nationalist gendered notion of ryōsai kenbo (‘good wife, wise mother’), and as the major mode for reifying normativity.
- Hosoda’s animations during this period can be said to feature some broader common themes, such as the existence of ‘two worlds’ or the portrayal of family relationships (Iida 2015a). 
### Queering
- We can understand this hybridity as ‘queerness’—a term that was once used to abject a certain population, but turned to become ‘the site of resistance… spawning a different order of values’ (Butler 1993, p. 231).
- The wolf-man impersonates transgressions of archetypical boundaries between human and animal, culture and nature, and city and rural areas; while simultaneously keeping the boundaries of gender norms, gender roles and the hegemonic gender order firmly in place. it is not meant to question broadly-fixed and gendered social structures.
- ‘we all have secrets and individual circumstances in real life too’ (Hosoda and Azuma 2013, p.17)
- The children, more so than their father, are portrayed closely through the dilemmas that their hybrid beings and their queerness engender as they grow up and unfold the differences at different levels: within themselves, between themselves, and between their own self and society (Throughout the course of the story, however, the two switch places as the girl makes a great effort to blend into human society, while the boy actively withdraws from it. )
- As such, the wolf children’s queer, unstable, non-fixed, multi-layered identities represent a major challenge and critique toward the given social order.
### Gender strategies
- In order to be accepted by her friends, Yuki realises that she must pass as a ‘normal girl’ and reconfirm the notion of a stable gendered identity. Her non-normative ‘wolf’ identity—which comes in the form of her outperforming the boys in a race, as well as in her boyish tastes and behaviour—is eventually covered up and disguised  in the form of a beautiful feminine dress that her mother makes for her, which stresses her gender conformity and thereby helps her restore her popularity among her classmates. Passing takes the form of gendering, and a specific gendering at that: the dress prominently bears a flower pattern that serves as a symbolic representation of her mother Hana, whose name literally means ‘flower’, as well as an acceptance of the gender role associated with her.
### Reifying Normativity: Motherhood and its discontents
- One of the rare gender-sensitive treatments of the film, Saiga understands that the real ‘monster’ of this film is not the wolf-man nor the hybrid children. It is the kind of civilisational super-ego of self-sacrificing motherhood that Hana embodies.
- Since the Asia Pacific War, the cherry blossom has also come to symbolise the young men who sacrifice their lives for the ‘family state’ (kazoku kokka). The gendered division and the societal and politico-religious state system that is thus reflected in the bookshelf as a structure—and in its symbolic content—suggest the film maker’s ideal society, along with the gendered cosmology that he reaffirms through the film.

- The issue of choice—which part of our natures we allow to define us and form the center of our being as we move towards adulthood—structures the development of the narrative through a series of strong contrasts in the film
-  the film eschews the familiar anthropomorphic device (particularly common in animated features) of having animals communicate in human language.
- Although Wolf Children is obviously based on a fantasy device, it imbues the conventions of the genre with seriousness through its emotional realism

>Mamoru Hosoda Exclusive Interview
>by Brian Camp May 21, 2013

- One thing about technology is that it changes all the time, ... I wanted to make something that’s timeless.
- I wanted to make this film to be about growth and change in these people, whether it’s a child growing up to realize what they want and what they want to become, or a child that’s very wild and untamed, to become more tamed and grow up, to become a grown-up young adult
-  I believe that fantasy stories, including western folk tales and children’s books, have some reality in them. There’s always something that reflects real life in the fantasy stories. People can learn and see and reflect their own life in the fantasy tales.
