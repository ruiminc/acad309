	- This image depicts the scene in Jiro's dream, where he presents his imaginary model of the Zero Fighter to his idol, the Italian engineer Giovanni. At this point, the Zero Fighter was in a very preliminary stage of design. It is only a sketch of the outline of a plane, but already we can see the beauty and elegance of the design. Jiro softly holds the prototype, and in the next scene, he will push the plane forward. Giovanni stands at Jiro's side. Although the audience cannot see his facial expression directly, we can imagine that he, as a great engineer, must be very proud of Jiro's design of such a beautiful aircraft.
	- This image directly relates to many aspects of the movie's themes. First of all, the scene is set in a dream, which is arguably the most critical scene in the film as it serves as a thread to link the stories together: from Jiro's childhood dream of flying, to giving up his flight dream and turning to designing aircraft, and finally, his deceased wife appearing in his dream. Aside from these expressions, the dream also has a metaphorical representation, indicating that Jiro's vision for his aircraft design is also "dreamy" or, in other words, unrealistic. It emphasizes the story of great dreams and how they are taken over by the waves of history (Maria Grajdian).

	- Miyazaki himself has said, "...It was wrong from the beginning to go to war. But as the Japanese opted for war, it's useless to blame Jiro for it..." In the movie, Jiro often expressed the notion that "Airplanes are not tools of war; they're not for making money; they are beautiful dreams" (Deborah Breen). However, despite all of this, I did not find Jiro (either the character in the film or the engineer in history) an appealing character. Throughout the film, Jiro is depicted as a man living in his dreams. He started off trying to build beautiful aircraft that had nothing to do with war. However, this should not be an excuse for him to ignore the fact that Japanese militarism was participating in WWII, invading China, bombing Pearl Harbor, and so on. Furthermore, Jiro himself was aware that Japan would eventually fail. Jiro simply hid in his own world and chose not to see reality. His designs turned into beautiful but lethal weapons, and he did not want to step forward and take action.

Evaluation

	- Unlike Miyazaki's previous works, which exhibit wild imagination, _The Wind Rises_ seems more like a beautified documentary. I would agree that the focus of the film is not about justifying the war. "The Wind Rises is neither an anti-war manifesto nor a pro-war revisionist rewriting of history" (Maria Grajdian). Instead, it focuses more on the relationship between war and individual people. Jiro is a lucky man whose dream aligns with the wave of history, and he does live on whenever the wind rises. The film effectively conveys this message.
