	- The selected image is adapted from the middle part of the movie when Princess Kaguya turned down the five men who wanted to marry her by giving them impossible tasks. She then left her mansion and took a journey to view the beautiful sakura blossoms. In the image, Kaguya dove into the rain of sakura, almost becoming a part of it. She danced and laughed hard under the tree, and it seemed to be the happiest moment of her life.
	- The reason I have picked this image is that the scene and plot that Kaguya played under the sakura tree marks an important turning point in the film and in Kaguya's mindset. This scene is the "ten" portion of "Kishotenketsu." Not long after Kaguya had enjoyed her time under the sakura tree, she was accidentally knocked down by a child from a seemingly lower-class family. Although Kaguya had no intention of blaming them, the family seemed terrified by her identity and apologized again and again before quickly leaving the place. This event, along with her encounter with Sutemaru and the responses from the proposers, made her realize that she was eventually bound by the identity of "Princess" and was no longer herself.

Evocation/Animation
-   What feelings, emotions or memories are evoked by the image? (2 pts)
-   How do those responses relate to a major theme or idea of the film? (2 pts)
	- Before this series of events, despite the conflicts between Kaguya and her parents regarding the cultivation of obedience to one's parents (Mika Saitō) and conflicts between her and her teacher, Kaguya generally did not hate being in the mansion. She was happy about living inside a mansion and smiled when she learned to write and play the piano. However, after the events, it became clear to her that Kaguya would never be the same bamboo girl again. She was the Princess now, and that identity forever segregated her from her real self. In order to fulfill her father's wish, she must marry someone she did not know, let alone love. She could not enjoy nature as she wished.
	- This is where the feeling of "物の哀れ" sets in. In fact, the scene of "failing sakura" is almost the most "authentic" scene to represent "mononoaware." More precisely, another word to describe the feeling is "物是人非," which can roughly be translated to "the things are still the same, but the people no longer are." The sakura tree is just as beautiful as if she were in a dream, but she is destined to become someone different, just as the sakura flower is destined to fall from the tree. She came back to the back garden, destroying her memories of childhood, as she realized her entire life is a fake. The only thing that is not fake is her love for this world, yet she will inevitably be taken away back to the moon.

Evaluation
-   How well does this image convey the overall message?  Is it effective and why or why not? (2 pts)
	- Combining with related plots and scenes, this would be the perfect image to represent the theme of the movie: Princess Kaguya danced so lively under the sakura tree, yet the sakura tree also represents "mononoaware," and she will have to leave this world. Such a beautiful image, along with the subtle sadness, perfectly puts "the good things, the bad things, the strange things, the amusing things, the humorous things, and the sad things of the world" all in one scene (Tama no Ogushi).
