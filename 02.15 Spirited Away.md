### Key themes
- Word and Language
- Motivations and Circumstance/ Good versus Evil
- the value and Meaning of Work
- Freed and Consumption (has reached the spiritual world and its not good)
- Environmentalism and Respect for Nature
- Rules: part of the world building, very important
### Ghosts, Spirits, and Kami
- Nature often represented by things outisde of language (Ohmu, Totoro, No Face are all speechless entities)
- Focus on "matter out of place"
### Miyazaki and History
- Tension between "kokusaika" (internationalization) and "furusato" (native place or hometown)
- Not oppositional, but "exist co-terminously as refractive processes and products and together they index the ambiguity of Japanese national identity and its tense relationship with cultural identity"
- ambiguous position between cultural identity and otherness and call into question “Japanese” identity in a changing world
### Memory and Identity
- Cultural pollution
- Alenation
- Fragmented or lost subjectivity
- Pessimism as subtext
- The bathhouse itself is situated between two worlds (old and new) and is not a simple space of "purity" or "recovery" of traditional Japanese cultural identity
### Sen and Chihiro
- Taking of the name symbolizes a lost of identity
- Reduces Chihiro to a number (sen, a thousand)
- Memory is a form of escape (e.g. remembering who you are)
- She also has to remember her parents (even though they have changed form)
- Equation of work with loss of identity
### Critique of Comsumption
- Consumption typified in opening
- Parents consumption patterns
- Entitlement (If we can pay, we can eat, “I’ve got cash and credit cards”)
- Materialism (Don’t worry I have 4 wheel drive)
- Eating without regard to effects
