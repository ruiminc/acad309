>"An Unfinished Project that was Also a Missed Opportunity": Utopia and Alternate History in Hayao Miyazaki's My Neighbor Totoro
>Michael Rustina,* and Margaret Rustinb

#Nature #Shinto/Kami 
- I want to note one remarkable aspect of the film that has received very little critical attention – the utter absence of "landscape" within it.
- not the representation of any existing tree but rather the figuration of a set of concepts signified by this tree: an erasure of the dividing line between humans and nature
- the absence of landscape and in its place a sense of the deep interrelationship between humans and their world; the reinforcement of all of this through signifiers of Shinto; and a clear expression of the forms of mutuality that pervade the community.

>Fantasy and reality in Miyazaki’s animated world
>by Michael Rustina,* and Margaret Rustinb

- we developed readings of classic works of fiction for children that focused on their symbolisation of crucial moments of emotional development. We argued that finding symbolic equivalents for the normal anxieties and transitions of childhood was a major achievement of this tradition, enabling one to understand the imaginative impact on adult as well as child readers of such stories
- We argue that their appeal comes from their makers’ understanding of central emotional experiences of childhood and adolescence.
- This film is like an illustrated bedtime story, in which both ‘real’ and ‘magical’ events are described #Nostalgia #Memory 
- We can think of Totoro and Catbus as ‘internal objects’ (in Kleinian terms) that sustain the children while they endure their parents’ absence. Nevertheless anxiety about the imagined loss of a parent (and at one moment both parents) is pervasive. The pictures and sounds of Mei crying in despair after her sister has lost her temper with her are heart rending.
- #### the relation between humankind and nature #Nature 
- The image of Totoro has become an icon of forest-protection campaigns in Japan. Awe at the beauty of the natural world is everywhere.
- soot spirit reflects anxiety, and is chasen away by the laughters. It comes back with totoro at the bus-stop when the anxiety is back again
- #### Human world
- Miyazaki shows us that the emotional experience of each the youths is different
- Miyazaki thus quietly observes that, when people have been made anxious, the impulse to accuse someone is strong.

>Walking Along With Nature: A Psychological Interpretation of My Neighbor Totoro
>Rieko Okuhara

- Tanaka's conclusion that Totoro plays the role of mother—both good mother and bad mother—during the mother's absence from home skillfully explains the reason for the popularity of the film. #MotherNature 
- In one scene, the sisters describe the night they spend with the spirits as "a dream, but not a dream", which is exactly how ethey experience their time with the spirits of nature #Memory 
- The film presumably takes place in Tokozawa, Saitama, around 1955. Miyazaki, who lives in Tokozawa, came up with teh idea of "Totoro". Miyazaki, who was born in Tokyo in 1941 and spent part of his childhood in Saitama, beautifully captures teh scenery and culture of Japan around 1955. Nature is sketched so accurately that the scenery looks almost like a photograph. It is easy to imagine Kanta as a projection of Miyazaki himself. #Miscellaneus 
- Jung continues that fantasies fall into two categories: "fantasies... of a personal character" that "go back to personal experiences, things forgotten or repressed," and "fantasies... of an impersonal character" that "cannot be reduced to experiences in the individual's past", which he calls the collective unconscious #Memory 
- Mei's situation and qualities: abandonment, invincibility, hermaphroditism, beginnings, and endings. Like the child who is cut off from its mother's care, abandoned or orphaned, Mei has to live away from her sick mother. Tanaka interprets Mei's separation from her mother as object loss. #Shoujo 
- Clearly, Mei appears as the Divine Child who is equal to the spirits of nature and possesses the power to bridge the real and fantasy world. In comparison, Mei is vulnerable in the real world, incapable of defending herself from danger. #Shoujo 
- Mei stands between the real world and the fantasy world and plays an important role in bridging the two worlds #Shoujo #Nostalgia 
- Only Mei can combine opposites: the real and fantasy worlds, the city and the village, manliness and womanliness, human beings and nature, the conscious and the unconscious #Duality 
- The child archetype also speaks for the "inner child"­­the part of a person that never grows up and is in need of love, comfort, and reassurance.
