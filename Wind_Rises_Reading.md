>THE BEAUTY OF COMMITMENT AND THE INEVITABILITY OF EVIL IN THE WIND RISES
>Maria GRAJDIAN

- Though it paints the reality of the lurking war, the anime movie The Wind Rises is neither an anti-war manifesto nor a pro-war revisionist re-writing of history. #war #controversy 
- On the background of on-going wars, life goes on, with its ups and downs, with its challenges and discoveries, with its love-stories and solitudes.
- “The human being has this only choice, to keep on living while permanently thinking ‘What am I going to do from now on?’. This is the only way in which life makes sense. This is what I mean through ‘Ikiro!’” - Miyazaki #live
- This urge to move forward in life inspite of all difficulties and hardships while simultaneously enjoying the beautiful moments in their very transcience is the fundamental topos
- there are two ways to mature life: The one is the common, direct, and brave path. The other is the bad and dangerous path, leading through death, and that is the genius way #live
- The Wind Rises is both an appeal to accept war as an unavoidable and to a certain degree necessary evil, and a reminder upon the position of the individual within the political system. #war 
- The Wind Rises tells the story of great dreams and the way they are taken over by the waves of history. #dream
- Historical belonging emerges from nostalgia as what one could call an “invented emotion” which allows for transfer of significance in historical terms, which leads, in its turn, to socio-cultural affiliation as the result of conscious choices on the basis of everyday events and accumulated life experience.  #Memory #Nostalgia 
- Thus, instead of waging a holy war for peace which won’t leave a single stone in its place, it is maybe sometimes more constructive to regard, at least for the moment, war as an inevitable, necessary evil to accompany our lives – and to accept it as such. #war

>Designs and Dreams: Questions of Technology in Hayao Miyazaki’s The Wind Rises
>Deborah Breen

- “It was wrong from the beginning to go to war,” he commented in an interview in Japan after the film’s release. He went on, “But as the Japanese opted for war, it’s useless to blame Jiro for it... - Miyazaki #war
- “Airplanes are not tools of war; they’re not for making money; they are beautiful dreams. #flight
- Historians may be tempted to read these images as a demonstration of the parallel existence of useful technologies; however, Miyazaki suggests otherwise through Jiro’s colleague Kiro, who laments the backwardness of Japan even as the country continued its strenuous drive toward industrial equality with Europe. #technology 
- “Japan went to war out of foolish arrogance,” but “for all this humiliating history, the Zero represented one of the few things that we Japanese could be proud of . . . [t]hey were a truly formidable presence.” #war #flight

>Miyazaki’s new animated film and its antiwar pacifism: The Wind Rises (Kaze Tachinu) 
>Daisuke Akimoto

- To ‘memorize war’ (senso okiokusuru) could be fictionalized; and this memory might be different from nation to nation, and people to people (Fujiwara, 2001: 53-56). From a Korean perspective, for example, the film can be regarded as a nationalistic ‘right wing movie’ (uyoku eiga) which beautifies the age of Imperial Japan (J-cast, 2013). #war 
- Jiro prefers fish rather than meat despite his friend’s suggestion to eat more meat. In Japanese culture, this also indicates that Jiro’s characteristic is not a masculine or militaristic type. #Miscellaneus 
- In sum, alongside Miyazaki’s antiwar pacifism, this film conveys the following philosophical message: Despite the difficult times, “we must try to live” (ikineba), pursuing our dreams and cherishing love.
