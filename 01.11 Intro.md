# Miyazaki
### Narrative and World Building
- Miyazaki's world is more focused on creating worlds than tellin stories
- world building proposes a set of rules from which a world (and the story contained within it) emerge
### Nostalgia
- the creation of a private world to live in , what Miyazaki describes as "a private world of one's own"
- it is a world he frames as "nostalgic"
- we may yearn for an earlier and lost possibilities
- born near the end of WWII, Japan was undergoing great political/social/cultural changes
### Elegy and Loss in Miayzaki's World
- reflections, even laments, of loss
- reminders to recover and to enjoys what is essentially human, even as we are transported to imaginary worlds
- separation from nature or questions concerning technology

### World, Time and Manga to Anime
- manga relies on "overexpression"
- example of Shoujo: how to dipict the inner working of mind/feelings, how to translate to anime versus live action film?
- how much of an inner world can be expressed visually?
### Miyazaki and Elemental Themes
- traditional notions of nature
- Many broader cultural themes emerge as an effect, rather than the basis of his world building. Nature provides the rules
- Cultural aor political themes function as "ornaments" on a larger tree
- Five themes:
	- Earth: balance between man and nature; pastoral settings and simplicity; space of kami and spirits; capable of both sustenance and great danger; overseen by the world of spirits
	- Air: mystical force; power and transcendence; flight as theme: liberation and risk; balance between human and nature; war and destruction; "magical force" both powerful and invisible
	- Fire: purification and destruction; greater conflict; pwer and nurishment; most destructive force when unchecked; heart or spirit
	- Water: dangerous and purifying; nerither good or bad, determined by our relationship; relationship with earth and fire, compliment to earth and opposition to fire; boundary, boarder
	- Void (memory): identity and naming; what does it mean to forget; memory is the key to nostalgia and link to the past; invitation to remember, both historical past, as well as our own past
### Shoujo
- features strong, independent, young female protagonists
- first by imagining strong female characters who embrace non-traditional feminine traits (including independence, violence, and conflict)
- and more important, by creating worlds in which these portrayals are not unusual, but are instead naturalized and realistic.
