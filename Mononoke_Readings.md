>Nature, Technology, and Ruined Women: Ecofeminism and Princess Mononoke

#### Japanese Anime
- Levi describes Neon Genesis Evangelion, one of the most popular anime series in America, as “a celebration of sadness and loss” (12).
- “much freer palette from which to choose its audience and subject matter”
#### Mononoke
- The film deals in nuanced ways with the conflict between the natural world, represented by the intelligent animal spirits of the wood and their champion San, and industrialization and technologies, represented by Lady Eboshi’s weapon-producing Iron Town. #naturevstech 
- In particular, Princess Mononoke’s portrayal of Lady Eboshi and San ultimately reflect subconscious anxieties about women in positions of power. #Shoujo
#### Ecofeminism #Shoujo 
- Eboshi
	- while her attitude toward nature is violent and uncompromising, she treats her own citizens with care and compassion
	- In Princess Mononoke technology is clearly associated with masculinity and destruction through Lady Eboshi’s defiance of (and ultimate submission to) gender expectations. #naturevstech 
	- she outwardly denies any character traits that might be read as feminine, that the men in the village respect her
	- She looks for increasingly dominant, more powerful roles so that she can be a woman, but must give up measures of her femininity to do so
	- It is interesting that she is out to kill that which is part of nature, the feminine opposite of technology, in order to maintain her femininity as well as her masculinity #naturevstech 
- San
	- displays characteristics of the savage, unrefined and uncontrolled femininity of nature
	- Mother Nature can often be split into two categories: good mother (providing, caring, self-sacrificing, and inexhaustible) and bad mother (dangerous, cruel, and torturous) #MotherNature
	- while Ashitaka may attempt to take on the role of stalwart savior and defender, San’s savagery and ferocity as the embodiment of “bad Mother Nature” will have none of it.
	- San ends this pattern of a strong woman who must always be tamed by a man, but is only able to do so by remaining entirely outside of the human system of culture and society.
	- First, Mother Nature, vengeful and powerful, is ever-ready should humanity/technology overstep its bounds. #MotherNature 
	- Second, we see that a powerful woman, in control of her own body and destiny, has no place in polite and ordered society. 
	- San’s options are simple: submit to Ashitaka’s courtly love, a love built on the sexist desire to shield, control, and protect, or remain independent but exiled.

#### Eboshi vs San #Shoujo 
- Both sides have justifiable grievances; both sides care deeply for the protection of their own groups
- both San and Eboshi are drawn as sympathetic characters, representing worlds that have their own unique beauty, as well as their own savagery. Miyazaki avoids the clichéd Western trope of good vs. evil and explores the issues of technology and nature in a way that affirms both. #Duality 
- "To lift the curse, the left would, too. But I fear it would not stop there." Ashitaka is well aware of the capacity of violence to feed on violence #Miscellaneus
- Ashitaka's willingness to meet violence with love, even at the expense of his own body, is a signature characteristic of his role as a Christ-like mediator in the film #Sacrifice #Miscellaneus 
- By an act of self-sacrifice, San and Ashitaka have redeemed not only Ashitaka himself, but all those in the conflict who were being eaten away by hatred #Sacrifice

#### Jidaigeki
- *Princess Mononoke* rejects "nostalgia" in favor of a perception of the present as a kind of "science fiction" in which viewers still have a chance to engage their present in light of a re-envisioned past. #Nostalgia
- "Mononoke": a reference to the raging, vengeful spirits of the forest #Nature
- With Ashitaka, Miyazaki subverts the Yamato-takeru legend by inverting most of the major twist so as to glorify the model of selfless service to one's community, humanity, the spirits, and the environment via harmonious life with all. #Miscellaneus 
- Miyazaki fashion Ashitaka as an "inverted" Yamato-takeru, to make the film coherent and credible
#### Representation of Women #Shoujo 
- (San and Eboshi) were alternatives for medieval Japanese women, albeit not very appealing ones
- exceptional if not marginal trends of medieval history in which women stood out, despite the forbidding threat of samurai violence
- depict San as avavistic human allies rather than the actual agents or receipients of spirit procession
#### Shishigami and Quasi-Shinto Pantheism #Shinto/Kami Kami
- highlight an aspect of Shinto, the *kodama*, to accentuate one of the most positive aspects of that form of religiosity, its sanctification of nature
- Only after the head is returned, the balance is restored
- "Shishigami cannot die. It is life itself. It is both life and death. It told me to live."
