- as if it is something that has been seen somewhere else and to make it uncertain whether it is a dream or reality" (Yu 2002, 16)
- Again, Miyazaki explains that he did not want the audience to think that the world Chihiro has experienced was all dreams (Saito, 117). 
- the leaves accumulated on top of the car and the wild grass grown in front of the tunnel & Chihiro's hair band given by Zeniba
- Today, the world has become ambiguous; but even though it is ambiguous, the world is encroaching and trying to consume (everything)
- Komatsu further comments that Kamikakushi is a verdict of "social death" in this world, and coming back to this world from Kamikakushi meant "social resurrection."
- Yubaba and Bo may be looked at as a pumped-up, well-fed version of Nagasawa Roan's Yamauba and Kintaro
- "...with the importation of Chinese traditions, the Japanese adopted the view of the spider as an emblem of industry and ability" (Baird 2001, 120)
- In both cases, the chased are the protagonists of the film, and the chasers put misguided anger against the chased, who are trying to do good for others.
- Surrounded by high technology and its flimsy devices, children are more and more losing their roots. We must inform them of the richness of our traditions. -Miyazaki

>Shinto Perspectives in Miyazaki's Anime Film "Spirited Away "
>James W. Boyd

- each one of us is basically in charge of our attitudes and our actions, and we can either give in to unfavorable circumstances or try to "clean up" matters and improve our situation, as difficult as that may be.
- through her tribulations cultivates a pure and cheerful heart which in turn enables her to help her friend Haku remember his true identity
- Miyazaki has this strange array of creatures come to the bathhouse to be restored to their original freshness
- Rather, these crone figures and No Face reflect a Shinto ethical outlook that views events in one's life as either reducing (polluting) or promoting (purifying) one's ability to participate fully in the life energy that permeates all of Great Nature

>Miyazaki Hayao and the Aesthetics of Imagination: Nostalgia and Memory in Spirited Away
>ALISTAIR SWALE

- Ultimately, there is a tendency in the latter essay to associate the nostalgic with an “authentic” past, as the reference to My Neighbor Totoro (described as “nostalgia drenched”) illustrates. This is a past, however, that can’t be accessed in any unproblematic way – it is a past that is lost, vanishing, or in the case of Spirited Away, subject to pollution and contamination
- This is not to deny that there are some genuinely Miyazaki Hayao and the Aesthetics of Imagination 417 mournful elements within the film – the notion of the abandoned amusement park, the river that no longer flows where it once did, or the broader thematic of lost identity.
- a nostalgia that “privileges the (literally) ghostly past as an alternative to the mundane present” (Napier, 2006, p. 293), as none of these are fantastic, mysterious or carnivalesque in themselves, although they cohere within a world that is profoundly heterogeneous and unstable, or, to use Napier’s term, “liminal”.
- “while Spirited Away may be read as voyage into the past, that past is not firmly locatable” (Lamarre, 2009, p. 96).
- certain stylistic stratagems in relation to “representation” may be deliberately accentuated, not due to mere technical constraints, but due to a conscious prioritising of tropes that have the potential to resonate beyond the literal
- the Kaonashi is about as “weightless”, “flat” and incapable of realistic movement as it could possibly be, but if this “animetic” image has its particular expressive capacity grounded in distinctive strategies for overcoming “weightlessness”, “flatness” and the incapacity to move fluidly, we are presented with something of a conundrum
- the Kaonashi could be interpreted as an emphatic denial of character, a figure that from a psychoanalytical perspective could be said to portray a state of castration

>Cavillaro

- The characters are born in repetition, repeately thinking about them in my head - Miyazaki
- "the bizarre, endless fecund spirit world is actually the "mundane" adult world, seen from the margins - at the gate of entry, as it were, with all its grotesquerie and strangeness fresh and intact" (Lanier 2002)
- render a particular atmosphere without recourse to verbal language
- Chihiro's face is, at first, rather stable and marked by feelings of either detachment or latent apprehension. As her character develops, her expression become accordingly more complex, varied and evocative of a wide range of emotions
