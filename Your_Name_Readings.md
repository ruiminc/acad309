>Disaster and Salvation in the Japanese Periphery. “The Rural” in Shinkai Makoto’s Kimi no na wa (Your Name)
>Timo Thelen

- its symbolic resolution in the movie offered the viewers a way to cope with the “national trauma”7 after the real catastrophe
- Miyazaki (Studio Ghibli) often portrayed very aesthetic and idealized rural landscapes in their oeuvre
- In contrast to the cities that emerged since the late 19th century, which are usually considered as anonymous and cold, a furusato indicates features such as strong social bonds and family networks, lived traditions and religious customs
- Reconsidering this sociocultural context, Mitsuha’s hometown Itomori might appear as a typical depiction of furusato with aesthetic elements like green mountains and old houses
-  the community bonds and family networks seem just as difficult as in Tokyo at some points
- The romanticization and fetishization of the “rural” is clearly mocked in Kimi no na wa. a parody of urban people’s obsession with furusato-themed rural goods or their consumption, which has indeed become a commercial trend since the early 1990s
- the depiction of rural Japan remains rather neutral in Kimi no na wa. 
- He (taki) represents a typical inhabitant of the center who barely cares about things outside of the dominant urban sphere
- the destruction of the rural sphere derives from a higher, non-human universe
- In contrast to the triple disaster, Mitsuha can ultimately be saved, and thus the movie provides a moment of “healing,” i.e. the fantasy of salvation from an inevitable natural catastrophe as devastating as 3/11.
- This kind of compromise of saving at least the inhabitants and their memory of the lost past appears like an emotional catharsis, like a kind of “healing,” as the worst possible extent of the comet crashing is shown in the original storyline
- Even though the tragedy itself and the devastation of the rural town cannot be prevented, at least its inhabitants can be saved. With their memory, “the rural” might not completely vanish. Thus, the movie may offer a kind of “healing” of the national trauma in its presentation of an alternate storyline.  the emotional catharsis aspired to by the movie can be regarded as one reason for its huge public acclaim in Japan
