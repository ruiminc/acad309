	- The selected image is from the first time Mitsuha transferred into Taki's body. She had to go to the part-time job that Taki had at an Italian restaurant, where she encountered two troublesome customers. It was Mitsuha's first time dealing with such a situation, and she had no idea what to do. Her facial expression consisted of a mixture of helplessness and worry. Apparently, Mitsuha was a little overwhelmed by the incident. Fortunately, Miki came and saved her from the trouble. In Itomori, a town of 500 people where presumably everyone knows each other, such a thing is very unlikely to happen.
	- This scene is directly related to one major theme of the film, which is the discussion regarding urban and rural lives. There is rather less conflict when Taki lived in a rural town; it seems that he adapted to rural life well. The conflict between the narrative of urban and rural life happens primarily on Mitsuha's side. She often criticizes the inconvenience of living in a rural area. This portrayal of the rural area is different from Miyazaki's "very aesthetic and idealized rural landscapes in their oeuvre"; rather, it is a _furusato_ which indicates features such as strong social bonds and family networks, lived traditions, and religious customs (Timo Thelen). Here, Shinkai is not trying to depict a binary narrative of "bad city" and "good village"; rather, the image of both urban and rural is complex. Mitsuha had enjoyed real coffee and snacks in the cafe, but at the same time, she must endure the fast-paced lifestyle as well as the problems she encountered at the restaurant.

	- I found the "longing for a different life" emotion discussed in this film particularly interesting and relatable. I grew up in Wuhan, a relatively big city, took high school in Singapore, and until now, have been studying in Los Angeles, arguably one of the biggest cities in the world. And I can always feel deep inside of me that I want to go somewhere more peaceful and quiet, where I can immerse myself in natural beauty. On the other hand, when I asked some of my friends here, I found, quite surprisingly, that their reason for coming to LA is because they are "sick of rural life where you have to drive 2 hours to the nearest Walmart."
	- Similarly to what Shinkai tries to convey in this film, there is no particular emotion of favor towards rural life versus urban life. The urban life is convenient and fascinating, but it is also overloaded and filled with consumerism and must be compensated with friendship, or else people cannot cope with it. Meanwhile, for rural life, people relate more closely to nature, and more tradition is preserved. However, the romanticization and fetishization of the “rural” are clearly mocked in _Your Name_, and corruption is found in the rural area as well (Timo Thelen). Life in Itomori is not more desirable than life in Tokyo per se.

Evaluation
-   How well does this image convey the overall message?  Is it effective and why or why not? (2 pts)
	- _Your Name_ discussed a variety of themes and topics. The two central themes it covered are the conflicts between urban and rural areas and the healing and emotional catharsis from the disaster. As for this image, it did not cover the moment of healing of this film. But it is indeed a very good representation that portrays the difference and discontinuity of urban and rural. Shinkai kept a neutral depiction of both sides for the audiences to reflect upon.
