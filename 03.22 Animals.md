# Ghibli & Animals
### Normality and Difference
- The general social context of anime is often based on hte exploratio of things outside of the "normal"
- Difference commonly manifests itself in the form of "otherness" or "outisder identity"
- Understanding "stigma"
- Hosoda "we all have secrets and individual circumstances in real life too."
- Hybrid identity reminds us of the comprehensive scope of identity and the social acceptance of stigmatization of differences
### Animal as Hybridity
- intersections of humans and animals
- Recognition of both/and
- Logics of transformation (how do we change)
- Emphasis of both the human and the animal (allows amiplification of the distinctive traits of both)
- Animality/Humanity as wish fulfilment
- Understanding the boundaries around animal/human
### Cinemas of Re-Assurance and De-Assurance
##### Disney
- Tradition of Disney as "Reassurance"
- Stabilization of identity (particularly female identity)
- Performance of American-ness, even via foreugn texts (goal is to fit outside texts into the American tradition)
- Female characters are reactive
- Courage and Heroism often perfoemed by male characters
- Changes in female empowerment follow cultural trands (but still tend to recover traditional norms and values)
- Promotes a vision of the world where harmony is restored and problems are solved (particularly in accord with US/western values)
##### Ghibli
- Ghibli films as De-Assurance
- Openness to outside cultures
- _Kokusaika_ (internationalzation) 国際化
- Blending of international and native elements
- Decontextualization and defamiliarizing of the contemporary
- Female characters as "other " and defamiliarization of the "feminine"
- Destabilization of conventional notions of pregress, history, gender, and identity
### Point of Contrast
- Comparison between Disney's _The Lion King_ and _Princess Mononoke_
- Assurance in the form of "the circle of life" (even if that requires sacrifice), recognition of anthropomorphism
- Deassurance in the form of nature which is hostile and never cozy or forgiving. Nature (deer god as nightwalker) is non-anthropomorphic and intesely "other"
- Reassurance is created by unification, Deassurance by separation. (e.g. San and Ashitaka agreeing to live apart).
### Anthropomorphism
- The relevance of speaking and non-speaking animals
- Convey a primary difference: speech as the primary mode of anthropomorphism
- Difference amplified (e.g. Ohmu, Totoro, and Dear God)
- Connection amplified (e.g. Moro, Jiji, The Baron)
- How do we regard animals that we can and cannot communicate with?
### What can we learn from animals
- Explore the chasm between humans and animals
- Reflect on our own animal nature
- Reflect on the means by which we remove ourselves from out animal nature (technology)
- Imagine ourselves as animals
- Animals as "otherness" "difference" and "loneliness"
- Human development as movement from animal to human
- Emotion and Instinct vs Sociality and Reason

# Animals and Nature
### Silent Animals
- Maintain connection to “nature”
- Have a role of purity or purification (e.g. Ohmu in Naussica)
- May serve as guardians or protectors
- Unable to be “reasoned with”
- Often tells us more about the people interacting than the animal itself
- Lack of verbal communication, but a strong sense of empathy
- Provide basic access or understand of nature in a recognizable form
### Animals that are Animals
- Form a connection between humans and nature 
- Usually a form of communication, though not verbal
- Often defined by trust of loyalty
- Sign of “character”
- When Ashitaka and Yakul share the same food it is a sign of his treatment of Yakul as an equal
### Animals that are Gods
- Animals often represent the personification of nature
- Nature in physical/animal form
- By locating nature in a body or form, it becomes recognizable and in a way meaningful (as opposed to amorphous)
- Particular traits can be highlighted
- Animals become “over-full containers” as these animals become more than animal (and more than human)
- Repositioning of humans between two animals (the lower and the divine), neither of which we can understand
- Communication through action and essence
- Even divine animals can have weaknesses, failings. And limitations
- Invites us to reflect on the “divine” in the everyday (e.g. there is a bit of the Deer God in all deer)
- Divine animals gain their power from a connection to nature, not by being outside of it
### Animals that are "Human"
- Often in the form of companions or familiars
- Jiji in Kiki’s Delivery Service
- The Cat Returns
- Allows us to reflect on the human from a different point of view
- Similarity versus difference/bridging the gaps in nature
- Voice of conscience or morality
- Metaphorical representation (both as an embodiment of an animal character and as a representation of a human quality)
